START THE GAME BY SELECTING THE MANIMENU SCENE!

Questions for playtesters:

1. In the first scene after the main menu, do all the audio and visual elements look cohesive (if not incomplete in some areas)?
2. In the first scene after the main menu, how does the sound fade between walking up the stairs and going back outside?
3. Did you remember to drink water today?
4. How does the speed and movement of the player feel?
5. Other than the 2 obvious openings, did you find any other tears in the map?
